When rendered, these blender files will use 100% of your CPU power to compute the frames.
You will see every single frame being put together. This can take many hours and your use of the computer will be limited!
I recommend leaving it over night or when you are doing something else anyway.
 

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
"20th Century Fox 2009" and "20th Century Fox Searchlight" and very complex and require 1-2 days of rendering on a good CPU.
"20th Century Fox Template" and "20th Century Fox Template 2" "only" require 5-6 hours of rendering on a good CPU.

PAUSING the render:
To pause the blender render, click Help, then Toggle System Console. 
Then press the pause (or break) key on your keyboard. 
To resume, hit enter. Do NOT shutdown your computer or close the program. 
Leave it open, and you can put the computer to sleep and resume afterwards.


DEFINITION of a good CPU:
- Quad core 4x3GHz or better
- NOT a notebook processor

SAVING:
By default the file is saved in this folder (the same as the template files) and is called 0001-0600.avi.
